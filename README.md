# Creativity: 
## the red leaf maple forest in Guadalupe National Park, TX

When I think of creativity, typically someone like Brian Wilson, of the Beach Boys, or David Bowie pops into my head. Most people dont associate creativity with a tecchnical skill such as coding, much like they don't associate the colors of fall with the maple trees of west Texas. However, as I enter into the world of coding I am pleased to find many opportunities to get creative and I decided to take this opportunity to share with people novel places such as Guadalupe National Park. My first real portfolio project is building a Ruby CLI app called find-a-park-cli, which allows users to search by state and choose from an array of outdoor activities to view a matching list of national parks. It's an excorcise in object oriented programming that utilizes the Nokogiri gem to scrape data off the national parks website.


# Nokogiri: 
## Ice fishing in Lake Clark, Ak 
Hitting a wall fishing for data. I'd cast my line out again and again only to get nothing. This was sort of like a winter in that the program was vary sparse and i was unsure of its outcome.


# Object Oriented Programming:
## Spring time in Death Valley, CA
Essentially, everything in Ruby is an object. An object is how we define talking about a thing. An object is also a function, it defines how it interacts with other things. A state is not only a name and abbreviation, "California, CA", but also in this context a state can have many parks, multiple states can have access to those parks, and there should never be more than one State with the same name. As much as I try to make the State class like a real state it will always be an artifact designed by me to serve my purpose and my purpose, in this instance, is to talk about the national parks.
My app was looking pretty bare.Some text here about how all the little critters come out in springtime. Objects are like creatures in an ecosystem that work in a mutually beneficial way. State object, Park objects, The Scraper and the cli class.

## Summer somewhere, SW
Creativity comes from solving big problems. Hitting a wall is the best oppotunity to to let your imagination explore its inventiveness.
