# Creativity: 
## Red leaf maple forest in Guadalupe National Park, TX

When I think of creativity, typically something like Brian Wilson, of the Beach Boys, or David Bowie pops into my head. Most people dont associate creativity with a tecchnical skill such as coding, much like they don't associate the colors of fall with the maple trees of west Texas. However, as I enter into the world of coding I am pleased to find many opportunities to get creative. My first real portfolio project is building a Ruby CLI app called find-a-park-cli, which allows users to search by state and choose from an array of outdoor activities to view a matching list of national parks. It's an excorcise in Object Oriented Programming while utilizing the Nokogiri gem to scrape data off the national parks website.

# Nokogiri: 
## Ice fishing in Lake Clark, Ak 
Hitting a wall fishing for data. This was sort of like a winter in that the program was vary sparse and i was unsure of its outcome.


# Object Oriented Programming:
## Spring time in Death Valley, CA
Some text here about how all the little critters come out in springtime. Objects are like creatures in an ecosystem that work in a mutually beneficial way. State object, Park objects, The Scraper and the cli class.


# conclusion: 
## Summer somewhere, SW
Creativity comes from solving big problems. Hitting a wall is the best oppotunity to to let your imagination explore its inventiveness.
